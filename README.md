# Daily Diet App

## A Node app to organize your diet and to lose weight

The idea behind the project is for you to organize and follow your diet schedule, being possible to know all meals, including off-diet meals and best sequence of meals within the diet

It's also a part of my personal portfolio, which I use to explore Fastify, Knex and practice with Node
